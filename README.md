# Python-Projects
 üé¨ IMDb Movie Data Explorer

This project is a beginner-friendly analysis of IMDb movie data using Python. I used Google Colab to clean the data, explore it, and create a few simple visualizations. It helped me get more comfortable working with real-world data and using tools like Pandas and Matplotlib.

##  Dataset

The dataset came from IMDb (via Kaggle) and includes columns like:

- genre
- rating
- certificate
- runtime
- votes
- movie title (header)

I focused on analyzing genres, ratings, certificates (like PG or R), and the most voted movies.

## üîß Tools Used

- Python (Google Colab)
- Pandas (for data analysis)
  

---

##  What I Did

- Cleaned the dataset (handled missing values and types)
- Found the top 10 most common genres
- Plotted the rating distribution
- Analyzed the most common movie certificates
- Listed the top 10 most voted movies in the dataset

Each of these steps helped me practice reading CSV files, filtering data, and creating visualizations that are easy to understand.

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Why I Did This

I‚Äôm currently studying Computer Systems with a focus on software development. I'm building up my data skills by doing small projects like this and using real datasets. This was one of my first data projects ‚Äî simple, but it taught me a lot.

##  Run It Yourself

To run the notebook:

1. Open it in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload the `imdb.csv` file
3. Run the cells top to bottom
